Task Manager MERN App
Welcome to the Task Manager App! This is a simple yet powerful web application built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js). It allows you to manage your tasks with basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality, complete with user authentication. Whether you're organizing your day or collaborating on a project, this app has you covered!

User Authentication: Register and log in securely with JWT (JSON Web Tokens).
Task Management: Add, view, edit, and delete tasks with a clean interface.
User-Specific Tasks: Each task is tied to the logged-in user for privacy.
Responsive Design: Works smoothly on desktop browsers.
